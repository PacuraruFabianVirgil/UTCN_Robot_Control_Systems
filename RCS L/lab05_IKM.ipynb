    "## Determination of an inverse kinematics model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous works we analysed the problem of calculating the pose of a Cartesian system attached on the end-effector, when the joint coordinates are known. This exercise proposes an approach a bit more difficult: we want to determine the joint coordinates for a specific pose of the end-effector. In other words, determine a set of coordinates of the robot $q_1,q_2,...,q_n$, that ensure a specific pose of the end-effector. This problem is known as the __inverse kinematics model__ of a kinematic chain. The main objective of this exercise is the description of a heuristic method for determining this inverse kinematics model of a robotic arm and to apply this method in two robotic kinematic structures."

    "The problem of determining the inverse kinematics model of a robot is a non-linear problem. For a robotic structure, we are starting with the numerical values of the matrix that describes the direct geometric model ($T_0^n$) and we aim at determining the set of joint coordinates of the robot ($q_1,q_2,...q_n$). For a robot with 6 degrees of freedom (6 motor joints), we obtain a system with 12 equations and 6 unknowns. However, from the 9 equations that result from the correspondence of the orientation from matrix $T_0^6$, only three of them are independent and the other 6 are redundant. This limits us to the determination of maximum 3 independent variables. If, on these three equations, we add the three equations resulting from the correspondence of the position vectors from matrix $T_0^6$, we obtain a set of 6 independent equations that allow us to determine a maximum of 6 independent variables. These variables correspond to the 6 degrees of freedom of the robot. This system of equations is non-linear and transcendent, often proving difficult to solve. Like all non-linear systems of equations, the main problems are raised by the existence of solutions, existence of multiple solutions and the method to use for solving the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering a robot for which we denote as $\\overline{q}=[q_1,\\; q_2,\\;...\\;q_n]^T$ the vector of coordinates of the robot, and as $\\overline{Z}=[P_{X},\\; P_{Y},\\; P_{Z},\\; \\phi,\\; \\theta,\\; \\psi]^T$ the vector of Cartesian coordinates of the end-effector, the inverse kinematics model (IKM) is represented by a system of equations that construct the dependence $\\overline{q}=f(\\overline{Z})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to determine the inverse kinematics model since the trajectories of the robotic arm are described in Cartesian coordinates, while the robot is driven by the motor joints and is therefore described in the joint coordinates. The inverse kinematics model is determined based either on the direct geometric model, on heuristic methods (e.g. for simple structures), on iterative methods (e.g. for more complicated structures), or on geometric methods. It is possible to determine either the particular solution of a model or a general (analytic) solution thereof. Applying heuristic methods is convenient but does not guarantee a unique solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem with the determination of the IKM, is the redundancy of the manipulator. A manipulator is said to be redundant when it is able to reach a specific pose under two or more different configurations of its kinematic chain. This translates mathematically in two or more solutions of the IKM and is linked with the appearance of specific mathematical functions, such as the square root or the cosine, which give usually two solutions: a negative and a positive one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in figure 5.1 we present a redundant manipulator with two degrees of freedom, and two configurations of its kinematic chain that generate the same pose of its end-effector.\n",

    "\n",
    "The choice of one over the other solution depends on external restrictions and on the construction elements of the robot. However, once a solution has been chosen, it should be used with continued consistency to avoid unnecessary displacement of the robot between the two configurations."

    "In a previous laboratory, we saw how to define links and how to combine them into a robotic structure, using the __Revolute__, __Prismatic__ and __DHRobot__ methods. We also saw how to calculate the end effector pose using the __fkine__, the jacobian of the robot using the __jacob0__, and how to visualise the robot using the __plot__ methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples above, it is 'easy' to calculate the inverse kinematics models by hand, but for more complex robots, we need to solve it numerically. The robotic toolbox has methods for solving the inverse kinematics model, using numerical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The toolbox can do this using the __ikine__ method (from inverse kinematics). The method works by providing a desired end-effector pose (position and orientation) and gives back the joint coordinates the result in the desired pose. As we know, the inverse kinematics model might have more than just one solution for a specific pose. The way numerical methods work, they start looking for a solution around a initial guess (which we can provide), and slowly converge to the joint coordinates that result in the desired pose. The convergence point might depend on the initial guess we are providing.\n",

    "The __ikine_LM__ method provides a vector of joint coordinates that results in the end-effector pose to be the one desired. To do so, we need to provide a pose as an input to the method.

This transformation matrix provides information about the 6 degrees of freedom available (3 positions and 3 orientations).\n",

    "The __ikine_LM__ method can solve the inverse kinematics problem even for kinematic chains with less than 6 degrees of freedom. In that case, we need to specify for which DoFs we want the inverse kinematics problem solved. We do this by providing a __mask__ as an input, which is a vector with six logical elements (0 or 1), specifying with 1 those DoFs that we want to solve the inverse kinematics for. The number of DoFs that we can solve the inverse kinematics for __must__ be equal to the DoFs of the robot itself."
