    "The arm of a robot is composed of a succession of rigid segments, called *links*. The links are connected with each other through articulations, called *joints*. The links and joints are forming a kinematic chain. The kinematic chain can be open or closed. Every link in a closed kinematic chain is connected at least with two joints. In the case of an open kinematic chain, the first link (base) and the last link (end effector), have only a single joint. There are two types of joints available when constructing a robot: joints that allow a rotation (R) and joints that allow a translation (T). If a joint is actuated with the help of a motor, it is called motor joint.\n",
