    "Up until now, we've been discussing about the position and orientation of the\n",
    "robot as described by transformations. However, it is of special interest to\n",
    "consider the derivatives of the positions, meaning the velocities and\n",
    "accelerations. This is especially important since robots can be used in\n",
    "conditions where speed plays an important role: We usually want to perform a task\n",
    "as fast as possible, while still making it safe for the environment around the\n",
    "robot. The objective of this exercise is to define a way for calculating the\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Theoretical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Velocity is defined as the first derivative of the position. When discussing the\n",
    "velocity of a point, we can only have a linear velocity, since a point does not\n",
    "have any specific orientation. When discussing about objects though, there is a\n",
    "distinction between linear and angular velocities. The linear velocity shows us\n",
    "how fast an object translates relative to a fixed frame, while the angular\n",
    "velocity shows us how fast does one object rotate relative to a fixed frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these velocities has three components, one about each of the axes of the\n",
    "fixed coordinate frame. We denote the linear velocities as $ \\dot{x}, \\dot{y}$,\n",
    "and $ \\dot{z} $ and the angular velocities as $ \\omega_x, \\omega_y$, and $ \\omega_z $.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since prismatic joints do not produce any rotations, their contribution to the\n",

    "\n",
    "For revolute joints, the contribution of each joint to each of the three angular\n",

    "\n",
    "The prismatic joints contribute to the linear velocity of the\n",
    "end effector depending on the orientation of the joint, similar to the way that\n",
    "revolute joints contribute to the angular velocities. If e.g. a prismatic joint\n",
    "is oriented with the Z-axis of the fixed frame, then the velocity of the joint\n",
    "results in a velocity of the end-effector along the Z-axis of the fixed frame,\n",
    "and no velocity in the other two axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the column of the linear Jacobian corresponding to a prismatic joint\n",
    "has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "   J_{u i} = \\begin{bmatrix} Z_x \\\\ Z_y \\\\ Z_z \\end{bmatrix} \\text{ (6)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, contrary to the angular velocities, the linear velocity of the\n",
    "end-effector does not depend only on the prismatic joints. The revolute joints\n",
    "have a contribution to the linear velocity of the end-effector as well. This is\n",
    "similar to the way that the wheels of the car, even though they are just\n",
    "rotating and not translating, they still cause a linear motion of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contribution of the revolute joints on the linear velocity of the\n",
    "end-effector are related to the orientation of the joint, but also to the\n",
    "distance between the joint and the end effector. This is because a revolute\n",
    "joint does not only change the orientation of the end-effector, but also it's position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the linear velocity resulting from an revolute joint is expressed as a\n",
    "vector, and more specifically as the cross product between the vectors of the\n",
    "axis of rotation and the vector connecting the joint origin and the\n",
    "end-effector. Therefore, for revolute joints the linear Jacobian has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "   J_{u i} = \\begin{bmatrix} z_{i} \\times (o_{n+1} - o_{i}) \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross product is an operation between two 3D vectors that results in a third 3D vector that is perpedicular to the first two\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <figure class=\"image\">\n",
    "      <img src=\"artwork/jacobian/cross_product.png\" width=20% />\n",
    "      <figcaption>Figure 4.1: Cross product between two vectors </figcaption>\n",
    "    </figure>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualise this for a 2D robot as in the figure 4.2:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <figure class=\"image\">\n",
    "      <img src=\"artwork/jacobian/linear_velocity_revolute.png\" width=40% />\n",
    "      <figcaption>Figure 4.2: The contribution of a revolute joint (q1) on the linear velocity of the end-effector. The cross product of the axis of rotation (blue arrow) and the radius of rotation (magenta arrow) produces the linear velocity vector (green arrow) </figcaption>\n",
    "    </figure>\n",

    "We've seen therefore how a revolute or prismatic joint can contribute to the jacobian of the robot and therefore to the end effector's velocity. In the example below, you can vary the initial pose of the joints (q1, q2) of a 2D robot and then see how the end-effector changes its velocity components depending on the selected joint and type."

    "As with the kinematics, it is usually more useful to be able to solve the\n",
