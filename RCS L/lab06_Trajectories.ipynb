    "# End-effector trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we have seen how we describe a robotic system in a static configuration, either when it is about the relationship between joint position and end-effector position, or when it is about joint velocity and end-effector velocity (but solved for a specific joint configuration). However, one of the most relevant tasks for a robotic system is to be able to plan its trajectory over time. This is important for two reasons: a) it gives us a way to control the velocity of the robot along a specific path b) it allows us to develop obstacle avoidance algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods for executing end-effector trajectories. In this laboratory we will explore a couple of them, starting from the most naive to more advanced ones."

For now, we will deal with position and orientation together, but later on we will see that we need to do different calculations for each component of pose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to control the position of the end-effector, we need to first have calculated the inverse kinematics model of the robot. If we know the inverse kinematics model, then we can control the joint coordinates so that the end-effector moves along the points of the trajectory.\n",

This is because the numbers of the transformation matrix are not all independent from each other, and each column represents a unit vector. As such, we cannot interpolate the numbers from our starting orientation toward the ending orientation, since the interpolated values are not guaranteed to form unit vectors. Consider the following simple example of interpolating from one unit vector to another:\n",
